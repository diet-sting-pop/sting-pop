                                I'm at a weird moment in my life, I guess every moment is weird but this one feels especially so. My ex is back in my appartement, for good reasons and I can't hate him for it but it takes me back to the same headspace I was in before our breakup. I'm a few months into my transition not knowing what I'm doing, I know I feel better as a woman but it's so scary leaving the confort of being seen as a cis man. Also not knowing what I will look like in the end, what I can expect and what would be outlandish to hope for. Also I feel stuck in my current job, not paid as much as I could but it's conforting to work in a big company and not having too much expectations put on me. I'm trying to do more art but I suck at every visual art and the results are never as good as I'd want to, I understand that it's normal when starting but it still is so frustrating. At least it's better than rotting in front of my PC watching the same youtube channels on repeat. At least I picked up sewing with a machine and I'm decent at it, I still need to better understand the machine and how to set it up properly before I can really start a real project, but I like it a lot. The sound of the machine, seeing the fabric move along slowly, controlling the speed with my feet getting a feel for it. It's really intimate in a weird way. Maybe I'm just talking shit to fill and blank page and not feel so bad about my empty website. It's hard to open up like that, I feel like I'm performing and sound like a teenager, but I'm just trying to be honest about myself here. <br/>
                                That's enough for now, let's hope that it won't be the only entry for the next few months.                            </p>
